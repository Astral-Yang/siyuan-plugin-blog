The notions sharing function you want is here too

## Core Features

* **One-click sharing**: You can share your documents with just one click on the LAN. If you need to share remotely, you can deploy it on a server using Docker and then install the plugin.
* **Permission control**: Only shared pages can be viewed, and pages that have not been shared cannot be viewed without permission.
* **Personal homepage**: You can set a shared page as your homepage, which can be used as a custom blog homepage.
* **Theme integration**: The default theme is [Zhihu](https://github.com/terwer/siyuan-theme-zhihu), and other themes will be supported in the future.
* **SEO optimization**: support automatically generating titles, summaries, and cover images for better SEO
* **Multiple Deployment Options**: Supports deployment as a plugin for the Siyuan note-taking software, self-deployment using Docker, and hosting on Vercel to meet different needs. For more details, please see the docs.
  - [Beginner-Level] Siyuan Note Plugin: Zero configuration, ready to use out of the box, runs as a local SPA application and accesses the Siyuan ontology directly, resulting in extremely fast speed but not very SEO-friendly.
  - [Expert-Level] Self-Deployment using Docker: Requires purchasing a server, SSR server-side rendering, SEO-friendly, high speed.
  - [Cost-Free Option] Vercel Hosting: Requires purchasing a domain and may not be accessible in some countries, low cost, moderate speed.
